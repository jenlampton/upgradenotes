Upgrade Notes
==============

A collection of upgrade "scripts" for moving from Drupal 6 and Drupal 7 to
Backdrop CMS.

Some scripts refer to a custom "Jeneration" module that performs cleanup tasks
and various updates as needed. Though the cleanup tasks may vary from one site
to the next, the updates often correlate to one contrib module or another. Most
of the "Jeneration" module is included here so you can benefit from these
updates as well.

## In this repository:

- "notes" directory: contains upgrade.md files for each site I upgrade.
- "code" directory: contains Jeneration module.
